\section{abstract}
18.4\% of German population has a migration background\\
question: in which way does immigration affect the labour market outcomes of the native population\\
theory:\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item the more inelastic the supply and demand relations, the greater the decline in native wages due to a given amount of immigration.
	\item displacement effect will increase the more elastic the labour supply and the less elastic the demand of labour (greenwood \& McDowell 1986, 1747)
\end{itemize}
this paper: 
\\
study based on employment sample from Institute of Employment research (IAB), 1975-2001.\\
\\
1.) skill groups as defined by Borjas (2003) already adopted by Bonin (2005) $\rightarrow$ immigration has only a small impact on native wages.\\
\\
2.) analysis extended to level of occupations based on idea that foreigners and natives will not compete for the same job (in this case the skill group approach will lead to biased result) $\rightarrow$ special occupational groups in germany have suffered strong adverse wage effects: \\
{\bf An immigration inflow which increases the number of employees within the group of service occupations by 10\% causes a reduction in native wages by 3.94\%}\\

\section{Conclusions}
{\bf The use of formal qualifications as an exclusive classification criterion may lead to an underestimation of the impact of immigration}
